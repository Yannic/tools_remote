# Remote client tool
This tool is meant to provide various debugging functionality for users of remote caching and
execution in Bazel such as downloading blobs and directories by digest. Details on using remote
caching and execution in Bazel can be found [here](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/remote/README.md).
